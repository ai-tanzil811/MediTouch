## 6. Database Design Approach
The database design follows a relational model with normalized tables to ensure data integrity and efficient querying. The design principles include:

1. **Normalization**: Tables are normalized to 3NF to minimize data redundancy
2. **Referential Integrity**: Foreign key constraints ensure data consistency
3. **Indexing**: Strategic indexing for optimized query performance
4. **Enum Types**: Used for status and category fields to ensure data consistency
5. **Timestamps**: Automatic tracking of record creation and updates
